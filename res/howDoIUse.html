			How do I use this program?</h1>
			
			<hr/>
			<p>This program uses PlantUML language, for creating UML diagrams right from your java program. Output is PlantUML code, which can be interpretated by PlantUML software or plugins for different IDE's. Check out the <a href="http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/running.html">PlantUML web-site</a> to get more information, about how you can turn PlantUML code, into the diagram. <b>Nevertheless</b>, if you <b>don't want</b> to perform additional actions, then our program and installed Graphviz software, is <b>the only</b> things that you need, to see diagram of your Java project.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>In first of all, if you want to see image of diagram in "Diagram" tab, you should install Graphviz software. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz web-site</a>. Installation process for different operating systems may vary. </p></li>
			<li><p>
				Then you should choose directory of your Java project, by clicking the button "Choose dir".
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Then, optionally, set preferred parametres of future diagram. Such as direction of diagram, shown relations, type of files to be parsed, and preferred type of diagram. Some parameters that you'll see, may be unavailable to use, that simply means, that we doesn't implement that functionality yet.Watch for changes. 
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Press "Generate" button. 
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				If all previous steps has been done correct, in tab "PlantUML code" you will see PlantUML code, and in "Diagram" tab, you'll see UML diagram that represents your project. 
			</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>If Graphviz installed incorrect in your system, and you're trying to generate classes diagram, you will see error message, generated by PlantUML, in the "Diagram" tab.</b></p>
